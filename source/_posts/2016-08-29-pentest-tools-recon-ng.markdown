In this post I'll discuss the use of the powerful web reconaissance framework, Recon-ng.

[Recon-ng is a full-featured Web Reconnaissance framework written in Python. Complete with independent modules, database interaction, built in convenience functions, interactive help, and command completion, Recon-ng provides a powerful environment in which open source web-based reconnaissance can be conducted quickly and thoroughly.](https://bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng)

<!-- more -->

Recon-ng is an invaluable tool for performing information gathering. It is modeled on the Metasploit framework, so the interface and functionality are pretty similar.

# Recon-ng core commands

With the help menu, you can get an overview of what commands are available:

``` plain
[recon-ng][default] > help

Commands (type [help|?] <topic>):
---------------------------------
add             Adds records to the database
back            Exits the current context
delete          Deletes records from the database
exit            Exits the framework
help            Displays this menu

```

You can already see the similarity with Metasploit. Let's focus on what's exclusive to to Recon-ng, the powerful recon capabilities. You can leverage different search engines and social media for information gathering. To leverage the most of this functionality, you will need to use API keys. Below you can see the available APIs:

``` plain
[recon-ng][default] > keys list

  +---------------------------+
  |        Name       | Value |
  +---------------------------+
  | bing_api          |       |
  | builtwith_api     |       |
  | facebook_api      |       |
  | facebook_password |       |
  | facebook_secret   |       |
  | facebook_username |       |
  | flickr_api        |       |
  | fullcontact_api   |       |
  | google_api        |       |
  | google_cse        |       |
  | instagram_api     |       |
  | instagram_secret  |       |
  | ipinfodb_api      |       |
  | jigsaw_api        |       |
  | jigsaw_password   |       |
  | jigsaw_username   |       |
  | linkedin_api      |       |
  | linkedin_secret   |       |
  | pwnedlist_api     |       |
  | pwnedlist_iv      |       |
  | pwnedlist_secret  |       |
  | shodan_api        |       |
  | twitter_api       |       |
  | twitter_secret    |       |
  +---------------------------+
```

In addition to the well known APIs of the main search engines and social media, there are the following:

* the BuiltWith Domain API, which provides XML and JSON access to the technology information of a website

* FullContact lets you easily query by email, phone number, or Twitter username. Results include publicly- available social profiles, photos, basic demographics, job titles, company stats, and over 100 other public data points. 

* IPInfoDB, which provides free access to IP geolocation tools

* Jigsaw is an online directory of free, downloadable Company information and more than 11 million business Contacts. Every Jigsaw business Contact is complete with hard-to-find direct dials and email addresses, while each Company record gives the low down on Company size, location, and industry. 

* PwnedList is designed for consumers to check if their email address has been found on commonly circulating lists of stolen accounts and passwords (this has been shut down at the time of this writing)

If you were to add a new API key, you could do it like this:

``` plain
[recon-ng][default] > keys add bing_api 007007
[*] Key 'bing_api' added.
[recon-ng][default] > keys list

  +----------------------------+
  |        Name       | Value  |
  +----------------------------+
  | bing_api          | 007007 |
```

To delete an API key, you can use the <code>keys delete</code> command.

To see what items are available in the framework, use the **show** command:

``` plain
[recon-ng][default] > show
Shows various framework items

Usage: show [banner|companies|contacts|credentials|dashboard|domains|hosts|leaks|locations|modules|netblocks|options|ports|profiles|pushpins|schema|vulnerabilities]
```

This should give you an idea of the kinds of data you can look for. Again, this should feel similar to Metasploit. In fact, like in the msfconsole, the modules are what you will use to perform different tasks. Let's take a look at all the currently available modules. Oh, and did I mention there is tab completion as well? :D

You can select a module via the **load** or **use** commands. Once in a module's context, you can see information about it with the <code>show info</code> command. Similarly, you can see the required options for a module with the <code>show options</code> command, and change them with **set**. Let's look at each module and see some usage examples

## Discovery

- DNS Cache Snooper - Uses the DNS cache snooping technique to check for visited domains

- Interesting File Finder - Checks hosts for interesting files in predictable locations

Let's see more about this module:

``` plain
[recon-ng][default][interesting_files] > show info

      Name: Interesting File Finder
      Path: modules/discovery/info_disclosure/interesting_files.py
    Author: Tim Tomes (@LaNMaSteR53), thrapt (thrapt@gmail.com), Jay Turla (@shipcod3), and Mark Jeffery

Description:
  Checks hosts for interesting files in predictable locations.

Options:
  Name      Current Value  Required  Description
  --------  -------------  --------  -----------
  DOWNLOAD  True           yes       download discovered files
  PORT      80             yes       request port
  PROTOCOL  http           yes       request protocol
  SOURCE    default        yes       source of input (see 'show info' for details)

Source Options:
  default        SELECT DISTINCT host FROM hosts WHERE host IS NOT NULL ORDER BY host
  <string>       string representing a single input
  <path>         path to a file containing a list of inputs
  query <sql>    database query returning one column of inputs

Comments:
  * Files: robots.txt, sitemap.xml, sitemap.xml.gz, crossdomain.xml, phpinfo.php, test.php, elmah.axd,
  server-status, jmx-console/, admin-console/, web-console/
  * Google Dorks:
    - inurl:robots.txt ext:txt
    - inurl:elmah.axd ext:axd intitle:"Error log for"
    - inurl:server-status "Apache Status"
```

I found this a bit confusing at first, but the SOURCE is the equivalent of the target you do recon on. I ran this on my own blog for a demo. When setting a target, keep in mind not to include the http or https (the protocol setting handles that), and also to exclude the trailing slash (I got errors until I did that).

``` plain
[recon-ng][default][interesting_files] > run
[*] http://chousensha.github.io:80/robots.txt => 200. 'robots.txt' found!
[*] http://chousensha.github.io:80/sitemap.xml => 200. 'sitemap.xml' found!
[*] http://chousensha.github.io:80/sitemap.xml.gz => 404
[*] http://chousensha.github.io:80/crossdomain.xml => 404
[*] http://chousensha.github.io:80/phpinfo.php => 404
[*] http://chousensha.github.io:80/test.php => 404
[*] http://chousensha.github.io:80/elmah.axd => 404
[*] http://chousensha.github.io:80/server-status => 404
[*] http://chousensha.github.io:80/jmx-console/ => 404
[*] http://chousensha.github.io:80/admin-console/ => 404
[*] http://chousensha.github.io:80/web-console/ => 404
[*] 2 interesting files found.
[*] ...downloaded to '/root/.recon-ng/workspaces/default/'
```

You can see recon-ng found 2 interesting files and it downloaded them to my machine

  identify Adobe hashes in the 'password' column of the 'creds' table, moves the Adobe hashes to the
  'hash' column, and changes the 'type' to 'Adobe'. Second, the module attempts to crack the hashes
  by comparing the ciphertext's decoded cipher blocks to a local block lookup table (BLOCK_DB) of
  known cipher block values. Finally, the module updates the 'creds' table with the results based on
  the level of success.

SUMMARY
-------
[*] 5 total (5 new) vulnerabilities found.
```

- Hosts to Domains Data Migrator - Adds a new domain for all the hostnames stored in the 'hosts' table

- Bing API IP Neighbor Enumerator - Leverages the Bing API and "ip:" advanced search operator to enumerate other virtual hosts sharing
  the same IP address. Updates the 'hosts' table with the results.

- FreeGeoIP - Leverages the freegeoip.net API to geolocate a host by IP address. Updates the 'hosts' table with
  the results

I used this to check the location of www.google.com host (resolved the IP first):

``` plain
[recon-ng][default][freegeoip] > run
[*] 172.217.16.100 - 37.4192,-122.0574 - Mountain View, California, United States
```

- My-IP-Neighbors.com Lookup - Checks My-IP-Neighbors.com for virtual hosts on the same server. Updates the 'hosts' table with the
  results.

- IPInfoDB GeoIP - Leverages the ipinfodb.com API to geolocate a host by IP address. Updates the 'hosts' table with the
  results.

- Hostname Resolver - Resolves the IP address for a host. Updates the 'hosts' table with the results

- Reverse Resolver - Conducts a reverse lookup for each IP address to resolve the hostname. Updates the 'hosts' table
  with the results.

- Address Geocoder - Queries the Google Maps API to obtain coordinates for an address. Updates the 'locations' table with
  the results.

Let's see this module in action with one of our favorite tech giants' addresses xD (I leave it to you to see what's located there):

``` plain
[recon-ng][default][geocode] > run
[*] Geocoding '1600 Amphitheatre Parkway'...
[*] Latitude: 37.4224713, Longitude: -122.0843333

-------
SUMMARY
-------
[*] 1 total (1 new) locations found.
```

- Reverse Geocoder - Queries the Google Maps API to obtain an address from coordinates.

So we have some coordinates. Let's see what's there:

``` plain
[recon-ng][default][reverse_geocode] > run
[*] Reverse geocoding (35.670337, 139.702573)...
[*] 1 Chome-18-20 Jingūmae, Shibuya-ku, Tōkyō-to 150-0001, Japan

-------
SUMMARY
-------
[*] 1 total (1 new) locations found.
```

- Flickr Geolocation Search - Searches Flickr for media in the specified proximity to a location.

- Instagram Geolocation Search - Searches Instagram for media in the specified proximity to a location.

- Picasa Geolocation Search - Searches Picasa for media in the specified proximity to a location.

- Shodan Geolocation Search - Searches Shodan for media in the specified proximity to a location.

- Twitter Geolocation Search - Searches Twitter for media in the specified proximity to a location.

- YouTube Geolocation Search - Searches YouTube for media in the specified proximity to a location.

- Whois Company Harvester - Uses the ARIN Whois RWS to harvest Companies data from whois queries for the given netblock. Updates
  the 'companies' table with the results.

- Reverse Resolver - Conducts a reverse lookup for each of a netblock's IP addresses to resolve the hostname. Updates the
  'hosts' table with the results.

- Shodan Network Enumerator - Harvests hosts from the Shodan API by using the 'net' search operator. Updates the 'hosts' table
  with the results.

- Internet Census 2012 Lookup - Queries the Internet Census 2012 data through Exfiltrated.com to enumerate open ports for a
  netblock.

This will come in handy to give you an idea about hosts without directly port scanning them:

``` plain
[recon-ng][default][census_2012] > run

[*] 7 total (5 new) profiles found.
```

- Twitter Handles - Searches Twitter for users that mentioned, or were mentioned by, the given handle.

- Github Code Enumerator - Uses the Github API to enumerate repositories and gists owned by a Github user. Updates the
  'repositories' table with the results.

- Github Commit Searcher - Uses the Github API to gather user profiles from repository commits. Updates the 'profiles' table
  with the results.

- Github Gist Searcher - Uses the Github API to download and search Gists for possible information disclosures. Updates the
  'vulnerabilities' table with the results

- Github Dork Analyzer - Uses the Github API to search for possible vulnerabilites in source code by leveraging Github Dorks
  and the 'repo' search operator. Updates the 'vulnerabilities' table with the results.

- Indeed Resume Crawl - Crawls Indeed.com for contacts and resumes. Adds name, title, and location to the contacts table and
  a link to the resume in the profiles table. Can only harvest the first 1,000 results. Result set
  changes, so running the same crawl mutiple times can produce new contacts. If the PAST_EMPS option
  is set to true, the module will crawl both current and past employees. Given a keyword, the module
  will only harvest contacts whose resumes contain the keyword. (e.g. Linux Admin)

- Meta Data Extractor - Searches for files associated with the provided domain(s) and extracts any contact related metadata

- HackerTarget Lookup - Uses the HackerTarget.com API to find host names. Updates the 'hosts' table with the results.

- ThreatCrowd DNS lookup - Leverages the ThreatCrowd passive DNS API to discover hosts/subdomains.

- Google Hacking Database - Searches for possible vulnerabilites in a domain by leveraging the Google Hacking Database (GHDB)
  and the 'site' search operator. Updates the 'vulnerabilities' table with the results.

This module is massive! Basically, you get Google dorks inside Recon-ng!

```

- SSLTools.com Host Name Lookups - Uses the ssltools.com site to obtain host names from a site's SSL certificate metadata to update the
  'hosts' table.  Security issues with the certificate trust are pushed to the 'vulnerabilities'
  table.

- censys.io port lookup by netblock - Queries censys.io to enumerate open ports for a netblock

## Reporting

- CSV File Creator - Creates a CSV file containing the specified harvested data

- HTML Report Generator - Creates a HTML report

I really liked the HTML report format. It classifies data into:

``` plain
domains	
companies	
netblocks	
locations	
vulnerabilities	
ports	
hosts	
contacts	
credentials	
leaks	
pushpins	
profiles	
repositories
```	

- JSON Report Generator - Creates a JSON report.

- List Creator - Creates a file containing a list of records from the database

- PushPin Report Generator - Creates HTML media and map reports for all of the PushPins stored in the database.

- XLSX File Creator - Creates an Excel compatible XLSX file containing the entire data set

- XML Report Generator -Creates a XML report

It took a while to list everything! As you could see, the Recon-ng framework is an information gathering tool on steroids! And if you can't find what you need among the current modules, you can write your own and contribute!

Until next time, here's the cookie straight from the cow's mouth:
