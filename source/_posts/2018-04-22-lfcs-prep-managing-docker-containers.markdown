description: Using Docker containers on CentOS
---

In today's post we'll look at Docker containers. Containers are lightweight application virtualization platforms that are isolated, but contrary to virtual machines, they share resources with the host OS. They are faster and less resource intensive than traditional VMs.

I've had errors with the straightforward approach of installing Docker on CentOS7. So I installed by following the steps mentioned in the [article about getting Docker Community Edition on CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/#set-up-the-repository)

Install needed packages:

```
yum install -y yum-utils \
  device-mapper-persistent-data \
  lvm2
```

Set up the stable Docker repository:

```
yum-config-manager \
    --add-repo \
    https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
```

Install Docker CE:

```
yum install docker-ce
```

If you get errors, look in the journal log and troubleshoot from there, but this approach solved the problems for me:

```
journalctl -u docker.service
```

Start the Docker service:

```
systemctl start docker
```

There are tons of containers available at https://hub.docker.com/explore/ . Here, let's look for a hello world one:

```
docker search hello
NAME                                       DESCRIPTION                                     STARS               OFFICIAL            AUTOMATED
hello-world                                Hello World! (an example of minimal Dockerizâ€¦   495                 [OK]
```

Pull the image:

```
docker pull hello-world
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
9bb5a5d4561a: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:f5233545e43561214ca4891fd1157e1c3c563316ed8e237750d59bde73361e77
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
```

Run the demo image:

```
docker run hello-world

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

The Docker default storage is at <code>/var/lib/docker</code>.  Now let's go beyond the basics and get an Ubuntu image:

```
docker pull ubuntu
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/ubuntu
d3938036b19c: Pull complete

Status: Downloaded newer image for ubuntu:latest
```

Check available images:

```
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
ubuntu              latest              c9d990395902        9 days ago          113MB
hello-world         latest              e38bc07ac18e        10 days ago         1.85kB
```

Run a command inside the Ubuntu container:

```
docker run ubuntu uname -a
Linux 05f2f247622a 3.10.0-693.17.1.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Thu Jan 25 20:13:58 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

Check all containers:

```
docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED              STATUS                          PORTS               NAMES
05f2f247622a        ubuntu              "uname -a"          About a minute ago   Exited (0) About a minute ago                       naughty_fermi
db7d3fcd06a7        hello-world         "/hello"            10 minutes ago       Exited (0) 9 minutes ago                            trusting_mirzakh
```

Take note of the container ID if you want to start a specific container:

```
docker start 05f2f247622a
05f2f247622a
```

To start an interactive session in the container with an allocated TTY, do the following:

```
docker run -it ubuntu bash
root@c8561feac38d:/# cat /etc/issue
Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS \n \l
```

Here we've run the bash shell inside the container. To return to the host, type *exit*

We've only scratched the surface, but we can see how powerful and versatile Docker containers can be.
