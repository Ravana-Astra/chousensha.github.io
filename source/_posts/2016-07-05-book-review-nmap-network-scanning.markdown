- Using Nmap from your work or school computer to attack banks and military
targets is a bad idea.

- Trinity scanned the Matrix with the command nmap -v -sS -0 10.2.2.2.

- As an author of open source tools myself, I'm a big believer in their power and capability. So I made a n effort
to use them wherever possible in creating this book. I wasn't about to write it in Microsoft Word and then
handle layout with Adobe FrameMaker! -> the open source tools used are listed

- beautiful and detailed diagrams

- fictional stories that illustrate the use of Nmap (think Stealing the Network scenarions - Fyodor is also a co-author of that amazing series)
- learn from the stories (always confirm the IPs that you are about to scan as belonging to the target organization - or else you might end up scanning the wrong target..like the army :-) )

- tons of other resources are presented

- In life's bleakest moments when all hope seems to be lost,
what should you turn to? Nmap, of course !

- pag 38 - Trinity's advanced technique of breaching security xD

- check out Nmap in movies at https://nmap.org/movies/

- examples of commands and case studies for their use

- useful tips: always double check that your target owns the addresses you are about to scan

- backstories

- examples of the use of additional tools that facilitate information gathering, such as dns tools

- funny comments
 
- examples and explanations for all commands listed in the man page + combinations and many more

- code description

- lots of TCP info

- low-level details of nmap and network operations

- case studies of users improving nmap for certain tasks

- site is more up-to-date

- info on scripts and how to create your own
