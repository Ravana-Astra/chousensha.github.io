description: Resources to get started in infosec
---

This is a compilation of resources that aided me (and still do) in my studies. When I started in 2012 there weren't so many tutorials/MOOCs and whatnot as there are now. Some of them I have covered in my [first Octopress post](http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2014/05/21/resources-for-learning/)

I will be updating this list and I will also try to keep it short, for sanity reasons :-)
