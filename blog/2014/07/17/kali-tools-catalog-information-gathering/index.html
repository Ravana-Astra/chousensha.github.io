<div class="entry-content"><p>Kali is an awesome distribution for pentesting. But with so many choices, one may find it daunting to find a specific tool for a task without having used it before. Or maybe you&rsquo;re wondering about some tools but don&rsquo;t feel like testing every single one. So I decided to briefly go over the tools provided by Kali and provide a quick description. Where available, I will use the ones presented on their respective websites / manpages etc.</p>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s begin!</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>DNS Analysis</h3>

<p><strong>dnsdict6</strong></p>

<p>Enumerates a domain for DNS entries, it uses a dictionary file if supplied or a built-in list otherwise. This tool is based on dnsmap by gnucitizen.org.</p>

<p><strong>dnsenum</strong></p>

<p>Multithreaded perl script to enumerate DNS information of a domain and to discover non-contiguous ip blocks.</p>

<p><strong>dnsmap</strong></p>

<p>dnsmap is mainly meant to be used by pentesters during the informatio ngathering/enumeration phase of infrastructure security assessments. During the enumeration stage, the security consultant would typically discover the target company&rsquo;s IP netblocks, domain names, phone numbers, etc &hellip;</p>

<p>Subdomain brute-forcing is another technique that should be used in the enumeration stage, as it&rsquo;s especially useful when other domain enumeration techniques such as zone transfers don&rsquo;t work (I rarely see zone transfers being <em>publicly</em> allowed these days by the way).</p>

<p><strong>dnsrecon</strong></p>

<p>DNS Enumueration and Scanning Tool</p>

<p>The script will perform the following:</p>

<p>Standard  Record  Enumeration for a given domain (A, NS, SOA and MX).</p>

<p>Top Leven Domain Expansion for a given domain.</p>

<p>Zone Transfer against all  NS records of a given domain.</p>

<p>Reverse Lookup against a given IP Range given a start and end IP.</p>

<p>SRV Record enumeration</p>

<p>Brute force hostnames and subdomains of a given target domain  using  a wordlist.</p>

<p><strong>dnsrevenum6</strong></p>

<p>Performs a fast reverse DNS enumeration and is able to cope with slow servers.</p>

<p><strong>dnstracer</strong></p>

<p>Determines where a given Domain Name Server (DNS) gets its information from, and follows the chain of DNS servers back to the servers which know the data.</p>

<p><strong>dnswalk</strong></p>

<p>DNS  debugger.  It performs zone transfers of specified domains, and checks the database in numerous ways for internal  consistency,  as well as for correctness according to accepted practices with the Domain Name System.</p>

<p><strong>fierce</strong></p>

<p>Fierce is a semi-lightweight scanner that helps locate non-contiguous
IP space and hostnames against specified domains.  It&rsquo;s really meant
as a pre-cursor to nmap, unicornscan, nessus, nikto, etc, since all
of those require that you already know what IP space you are looking
for.  This does not perform exploitation and does not scan the whole
internet indiscriminately.  It is meant specifically to locate likely
targets both inside and outside a corporate network.  Because it uses
DNS primarily you will often find mis-configured networks that leak
internal address space. That&rsquo;s especially useful in targeted malware.</p>

<p><strong>urlcrazy</strong></p>

<p>Generate and test domain typos and variations to detect and perform typo squatting, URL hijacking,
phishing, and corporate espionage.</p>

<h3>IDS/IPS Identification</h3>

<p><strong>fragroute</strong></p>

<p>intercept, modify, and rewrite egress traffic</p>

<p><strong>fragrouter</strong></p>

<p>network intrusion detection evasion toolkit</p>

<p><strong>ftest</strong></p>

<p>FTester is a tool designed for testing firewalls filtering policies and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>lbd</strong></p>

<p>load balancing detector &ndash; Checks if a given domain uses load-balancing</p>

<p><strong>wafw00f</strong></p>

<p>Web Application Firewall Detection Tool</p>

<h3>Live Host Identification</h3>

<p><strong>alive6</strong></p>

<p>an effective alive scanner, which will detect all systems listening to this address</p>

<p><strong>arping</strong></p>

<p>sends ARP and/or ICMP requests to the specified host and  displays  the  replies.</p>

<p><strong>cdpsnarf</strong></p>

<p>Cisco Discovery Protocol Sniffer</p>

<p>CDPSnarf is a network sniffer exclusively written to extract
information from CDP packets.
It provides all the information a &ldquo;show cdp neighbors detail&rdquo;
command would return on a Cisco router and even more.</p>

<p><strong>detect-new-ip6</strong></p>

<p>This tool detects new IPv6 addresses joining the local network.</p>

<p><strong>detect_sniffer6</strong></p>

<p>Tests if systems on the local LAN are sniffing.
Works against Windows, Linux, OS/X and *BSD
If no target is given, the link-local-all-nodes address is used, which
however not always works.</p>

<p><strong>dmitry</strong></p>

<p>DMitry (Deepmagic Information Gathering Tool) is a UNIX/(GNU)Linux command line application with the ability to gather as much information as possible about a host.</p>

<p>Basic  functionality  of  DMitry  allows for information to be gathered
about a target host from a simple whois lookup on the target to  uptime
reports and TCP portscans.</p>

<p>The application is considered a tool to assist in information gathering
when information is required quickly by removing the need to enter multiple  commands  and  the timely process of searching through data from multiple sources.</p>

<p><strong>dnmap-client</strong> &amp; <strong>dnmap-server</strong></p>

<p>dnmap is a framework to distribute nmap scans among several clients. It reads an already created file with nmap commands and send those commands to each client connected to it. The framework use a client/server architecture. The server knows what to do and the clients do it. All the logic and statistics are managed in the server. Nmap output is stored on both server and client. Usually you would want this if you have to scan a large group of hosts and you have several different internet connections (or friends that want to help you)</p>

<p><strong>fping</strong></p>

<p>send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts</p>

<p><strong>hping3</strong></p>

<p>hping3 is a network tool able to send custom TCP/IP packets and to display target replies like ping program does with  ICMP  replies.  hping3 handle  fragmentation,  arbitrary packets body and size and can be used in order to transfer  files  encapsulated  under  supported  protocols.
Using hping3 you are able to perform at least the following stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li>Test firewall rules</li>
<li>Advanced port scanning</li>
<li>Test net performance using different protocols, packet size, TOS (type of service) and fragmentation.</li>
<li>Path MTU discovery</li>
<li>Transferring files between even really fascist firewall rules.</li>
<li>Traceroute-like under different protocols.</li>
<li>Firewalk-like usage.</li>
<li>Remote OS fingerprinting.</li>
<li>TCP/IP stack auditing.</li>
<li>A lot of others.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>inverse_lookup6</strong></p>

<p>Performs an inverse address query, to get the IPv6 addresses that are assigned
to a MAC address. Note that only few systems support this yet.</p>

<p><strong>miranda</strong></p>

<p>Miranda can discover UPnP hosts either passively or actively, and all of a host’s reported devices types, services, actions and variables can be enumerated with a single command.</p>

<p><strong>ncat</strong></p>

<p>Ncat is a feature-packed networking utility which reads and writes data
across networks from the command line. Ncat was written for the Nmap
Project and is the culmination of the currently splintered family of
Netcat incarnations. It is designed to be a reliable back-end tool to
instantly provide network connectivity to other applications and users.
Ncat will not only work with IPv4 and IPv6 but provides the user with a
virtually limitless number of potential uses.</p>

<p>Among Ncat&rsquo;s vast number of features there is the ability to chain
Ncats together; redirection of TCP, UDP, and SCTP ports to other sites;
SSL support; and proxy connections via SOCKS4 or HTTP proxies (with
optional proxy authentication as well).</p>

<p><strong>netdiscover</strong></p>

<p>an active/passive arp reconnaissance tool.</p>

<p><strong>passive_discovery6</strong></p>

<p>Passivly sniffs the network and dump all client&rsquo;s IPv6 addresses detected.</p>

<p><strong>thcping6</strong></p>

<p>Craft a ICMPv6/TCP/UDP packet with special IPv6 or EH header options.</p>

<p><strong>wol-e</strong></p>

<p>WOL-E is a suite of tools for the Wake on LAN feature of network attached computers, this is now enabled by default on many Apple computers. These tools include:</p>

<p>Bruteforcing the MAC address to wake up clients
Sniffing WOL attempts on the network and saving them to disk
Sniffing WOL passwords on the network and saving them to disk
Waking up single clients (post sniffing attack)
Scanning for Apple devices on the network for WOL enabling
Sending bulk WOL requests to all detected Apple clients.</p>

<p><strong>xprobe2</strong></p>

<p>xprobe2 is an active operating system fingerprinting tool with  a  different  approach  to operating system fingerprinting. xprobe2 relies on fuzzy  signature  matching,  probabilistic  guesses,  multiple  matches simultaneously, and a signature database.</p>

<h3>Network Scanners</h3>

<p><strong>nmap</strong></p>

<p>Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network exploration
and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks,
although it works fine against single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets
in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network,
what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering,
what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of
packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits, many
systems and network administrators find it useful for routine tasks
such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and
monitoring host or service uptime.</p>

<p><strong>unicornscan</strong></p>

<p>asynchronous network stimulus delivery/response recoring tool.</p>

<p><strong>zenmap</strong></p>

<p>Zenmap is a multi-platform graphical Nmap frontend and results viewer.
Zenmap aims to make Nmap easy for beginners to use while giving
experienced Nmap users advanced features. Frequently used scans can be
saved as profiles to make them easy to run repeatedly. A command
creator allows interactive creation of Nmap command lines. Scan results
can be saved and viewed later. Saved scan results can be compared with
one another to see how they differ. The results of recent scans are
stored in a searchable database.</p>

<h3>OS Fingerprinting</h3>

<p>Covered in the above</p>

<h3>OSINT Analysis</h3>

<p><strong>casefile</strong></p>

<p>CaseFile is the little brother to Maltego. It targets a unique market of &lsquo;offline&rsquo; analysts whose primary sources of information are not gained from the open-source intelligence side or can be programmatically queried. We see these people as investigators and analysts who are working &lsquo;on the ground&rsquo;, getting intelligence from other people in the team and building up an information map of their investigation.</p>

<p>CaseFile gives you the ability to quickly add, link and analyze data having the same graphing flexibility and performance as Maltego without the use of transforms.</p>

<p><strong>creepy</strong></p>

<p>creepy  is an application that allows you to gather geolocation related
information about users from  social  networking  platforms  and  image
hosting  services.  The  information  is  presented in a map inside the
application where all the retrieved data is shown accompanied with relevant information (i.e. what was posted from that specific location) to
provide context to the presentation.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/creepy.png" title="creepy" alt="creepy"></p>

<p><strong>metagoofil</strong></p>

<p>Metagoofil is an information gathering tool designed for extracting metadata of public documents (pdf,doc,xls,ppt,docx,pptx,xlsx) belonging to a target company.</p>

<p>Metagoofil will perform a search in Google to identify and download the documents to local disk and then will extract the metadata with different libraries like Hachoir, PdfMiner? and others. With the results it will generate a report with usernames, software versions and servers or machine names that will help Penetration testers in the information gathering phase.</p>

<p><strong>recon-ng</strong></p>

<p>Recon-ng is a full-featured Web Reconnaissance framework written in Python. Complete with independent modules, database interaction, built in convenience functions, interactive help, and command completion, Recon-ng provides a powerful environment in which open source web-based reconnaissance can be conducted quickly and thoroughly.</p>

<p><strong>intrace</strong></p>

<p>InTrace is a traceroute-like application that enables users to enumerate IP hops exploiting existing TCP connections, both initiated from local network (local system) or from remote hosts.</p>

<p><strong>netmask</strong></p>

<p>This  program  accepts and produces a variety of common network address
and netmask formats.  Not only can it convert address and netmask notations,  but it will optimize the masks to generate the smallest list of
rules.  This is very handy if you&rsquo;ve  ever  configured  a  firewall  or
router  and  some  nasty  network administrator before you decided that
base 10 numbers were good places to start and end groups of machines.</p>

<p><strong>trace6</strong></p>

<p>A basic but very fast traceroute6 program.
If no port is specified, ICMP6 Ping requests are used, otherwise TCP SYN
packets to the specified port.</p>

<h3>Service Fingerprinting</h3>

<p><strong>implementation6</strong></p>

<p>Performs some IPv6 implementation checks, can be used to test some
firewall features too. Takes approx. 2 minutes to complete.</p>

<p><strong>implementation6d</strong></p>

<p>Identifies test packets by the implementation6 tool, useful to check what
packets passed a firewall</p>

<p><strong>sslscan</strong></p>

<p>SSLScan is a fast SSL port scanner. SSLScan connects to SSL
ports and determines what  ciphers are supported, which are
the servers  preferred  ciphers,  which  SSL  protocols  are
supported  and   returns  the   SSL   certificate.   Client
certificates /  private key can be configured and output is
to text / XML.</p>

<p><strong>sslyze</strong></p>

<p>SSLyze is a Python tool that can analyze the SSL configuration of a server by connecting to it. It is designed to be fast and comprehensive, and should help organizations and testers identify misconfigurations affecting their SSL servers.</p>

<p><strong>tlssled</strong></p>

<p>ssl tls scanner</p>

<h3>SMB Analysis</h3>

<p><strong>acccheck</strong></p>

<p>Attempts to connect to the IPC$ and ADMIN$ shares depending on which flags have been
chosen, and tries a combination of usernames and passwords in the hope to identify
the password to a given account via a dictionary password guessing attack.</p>

<p><strong>nbtscan</strong></p>

<p>nbtscan is a program for scanning IP networks for NetBIOS name information.  It  sends NetBIOS status query to each address in supplied range and lists  received  information  in  human  readable  form.  For  each responded  host  it  lists IP address, NetBIOS computer name, logged-in user name and MAC address (such as Ethernet).</p>

<h3>SMTP Analysis</h3>

<p><strong>smtp-user-enum</strong></p>

<p>Username guessing tool primarily for use against the default Solaris SMTP service. Can use either EXPN, VRFY or RCPT TO</p>

<p><strong>swaks</strong></p>

<p>swaks&#8217; primary design goal is to be a flexible, scriptable,
transaction-oriented SMTP test tool.  It handles SMTP features and
extensions such as TLS, authentication, and pipelining; multiple
version of the SMTP protocol including SMTP, ESMTP, and LMTP; and
multiple transport methods including unix-domain sockets, internet-
domain sockets, and pipes to spawned processes.  Options can be
specified in environment variables, configuration files, and the
command line allowing maximum configurability and ease of use for
operators and scripters.</p>

<h3>SNMP Analysis</h3>

<p><strong>braa</strong></p>

<p>Braa is a tool for making SNMP queries. It is able to query hundreds or thousands of hosts simultaneously, while being completely single-threaded. It does not need any SNMP libraries, as it is equipped with its own SNMP engine</p>

<p><strong>cisco-auditing-tool</strong></p>

<p>Perl script which scans cisco routers for common vulnerabilities. Checks for default passwords, easily guessable community names, and the IOS history bug. Includes support for plugins and scanning multiple hosts.</p>

<p><strong>cisco-torch</strong></p>

<p>mass scanning, application layer fingerprinting, and exploitation tool to discover and attack remote Cisco hosts running Telnet, SSH, Web, TFTP, NTP and SNMP services. Useful in auditing large networks for misconfigured/un-updated Ciscos.</p>

<p><strong>copy-router-config</strong></p>

<p>copy an entire router configuration file from a Cisco device</p>

<p><strong>merge-router-config</strong></p>

<p>make changes to a Cisco router configuration file and merge those changes to a Cisco router</p>

<p><strong>onesixtyone</strong></p>

<p>simple SNMP scanner which sends requests for the  sys‐Descr value asynchronously with user-adjustable sending times.</p>

<p><strong>snmpcheck</strong></p>

<p>SNMP device enumerator</p>

<h3>SSL Analysis</h3>

<p><strong>sslcaudit</strong></p>

<p>This tool is designed to automate testing SSL/TLS clients for resistance against MITM attacks</p>

<p><strong>ssldump</strong></p>

<p>ssldump is an SSL/TLS network protocol analyzer. It identifies TCP connections on the chosen network interface and attempts to interpret them as  SSL/TLS traffic. When it identifies SSL/TLS traffic, it decodes the records and displays them in a textual form to stdout. If provided with the  appropriate  keying material, it will also decrypt the connections and display the application data traffic.</p>

<p><strong>sslh</strong></p>

<p>ssl/ssh multiplexer</p>

<p><strong>sslsniff</strong></p>

<p>sslsniff  is  designed  to  create man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks for
SSL/TLS connections, and dynamically generates certs  for  the  domains
that  are  being  accessed  on  the  fly. The new certificates are constructed in a certificate chain that is signed by any certificate  that is provided.
sslsniff  also  supports other attacks like null-prefix or OCSP attacks
to achieve silent interceptions of connections when possible.</p>

<p><strong>sslsplit</strong></p>

<p>SSLsplit  is  a  tool  for  man-in-the-middle  attacks  against SSL/TLS
encrypted network connections.  Connections  are  transparently  intercepted  through  a network address translation engine and redirected to
SSLsplit.  SSLsplit terminates SSL/TLS and initiates a new SSL/TLS connection  to  the  original  destination address, while logging all data
transmitted.  SSLsplit is intended to be useful for  network  forensics
and penetration testing.</p>

<p><strong>sslstrip</strong></p>

<p>SSL/TLS man-in-the-middle attack tool</p>

<p><strong>stunnel</strong></p>

<p>The stunnel program is designed to work as SSL encryption wrapper
between remote clients and local (inetd-startable) or remote servers.
The concept is that having non-SSL aware daemons running on your system
you can easily set them up to communicate with clients over secure SSL channels.</p>

<h3>Telephony Analysis</h3>

<p><strong>ace</strong></p>

<p>Automated Corporate (Data) Enumerator</p>

<h3>Traffic Analysis</h3>

<p><strong>irpas-ass</strong></p>

<p>Autonomous System Scanner</p>

<p><strong>irpass-cdp</strong></p>

<p>This program is for sending CDP (Cisco router Discovery Protocol) messages to the wire.</p>

<p><strong>p0f</strong></p>

<p>P0f is a tool that utilizes an array of sophisticated, purely passive traffic
fingerprinting mechanisms to identify the players behind any incidental TCP/IP
communications (often as little as a single normal SYN) without interfering in
any way.</p>

<p>Some of its capabilities include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Highly scalable and extremely fast identification of the operating system
and software on both endpoints of a vanilla TCP connection &ndash; especially in
settings where NMap probes are blocked, too slow, unreliable, or would
simply set off alarms,</p></li>
<li><p>Measurement of system uptime and network hookup, distance (including
topology behind NAT or packet filters), and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>Automated detection of connection sharing / NAT, load balancing, and
application-level proxying setups.</p></li>
<li><p>Detection of dishonest clients / servers that forge declarative statements
such as X-Mailer or User-Agent.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>tcpflow</strong></p>

<p>tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient for protocol analysis or debugging.</p>

<p><strong>wireshark</strong></p>

<p>Wireshark is a GUI network protocol analyzer.  It lets you
interactively browse packet data from a live network or from a
previously saved capture file.</p>

<h3>VoIP Analysis</h3>

<p><strong>enumiax</strong></p>

<p>enumIAX is an Inter Asterisk Exchange version 2 (IAX2) protocol username brute-force enumerator.</p>

<h3>VPN Analysis</h3>

<p><strong>ike-scan</strong></p>

<p>Discover and fingerprint IKE hosts (IPsec VPN servers)</p>

<p>Ok, that took forever. I will make posts with the other categories as well.</p>

  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I am an information security enthusiast and I love Python and Linux. I got seriously interested in this field somewhere in 2012, and since then it's been a non-stop learning journey. I don't have a formal education in computer science, but I've been studying by myself with the help of various books, sites, online classes and of course, lots of practice.</p>
